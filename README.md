# Final Project for the Big Data Analytics Course Exam

**Master's Degree Course in Management Engineering, Bari Polytechnic University.**

The project, explained in detail in the main file, focuses on classifying real and fake images of two different types using neural networks:
- Real vs AI-generated images
- Real vs adversarial attacked images

## Group Members
- Benestare Domenico
- Annello Fabrizio
- Margheriti Vincenzo

## Repository Contents
Within the repository, there are three files:
- `Classification_main_project.ipynb`: The main file where the final project is detailed.
- `Adversarial_database_creation.ipynb`: The model used to generate the adversarial database, utilizing attack libraries.
- `Test_optimizations_model_on_adversarial.ipynb`: A final addition containing only adversarial data, uncommented. It is used to test various variations of the main model to better understand the results obtained.
- `DATASETS.md`: Direct Google Drive link to the various datasets used.
